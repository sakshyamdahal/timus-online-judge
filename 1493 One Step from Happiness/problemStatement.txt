Vova bought a ticket in a tram of the 13th route and counted the sums of the first three and the last three digits of the ticket's number (the number has six digits). It turned out that the sums differed by one exactly. "I'm one step from happiness," Vova thought, "either the previous or the next ticket is lucky." Is he right?
Input
The input contains the number of the ticket. The number consists of six digits, some of which can be zeros. It is guaranteed that Vova counted correctly, i.e., that the sum of the first three digits differs from the sum of the last three digits by one exactly.
Output
Output "Yes" if Vova is right and "No" otherwise.
