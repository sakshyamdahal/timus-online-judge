Here is a farm. Here is a farmer that counts how many animal live in his farm: a camels, b sheep, c green cockroaches. Occurs that an + bn = cn. n is given. You are to find all the rest.
Input
n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100)
Output
Three different integers (a, b and c) such that an + bn = cn, 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100. If there are several solutions you should output the one where a is minimal. If there are several solutions with the minimal a you should output the one with minimal b, and so on. Output −1 if there is no solution.
