You are given the whole numbers N, M and Y. Write a program that will find all whole numbers X in the interval [0, M − 1] such that XN mod M = Y.
Input
The input contains a single line with N, M and Y (0 < N < 999, 1 < M < 999, 0 < Y < 999) separated with one space.
Output
Output all numbers X separated with space on one line. The numbers must be written in ascending order. If no such numbers exist then output −1.
